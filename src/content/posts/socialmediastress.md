Let me start with a personal confession: I used to think I was using social media for fun, creativity, and 
as part of my work as an artist. It felt innocent at first, sharing my work, connecting with others, and 
watching my audience grow. But over time, something shifted. Scrolling through endless posts became less 
about fun and more about filling a void I didn’t even know I had. I found myself reaching for my phone whenever 
I had a spare second, comparing my life to perfectly curated feeds, and feeling anxious when I wasn’t “in the loop.”

It hit me one day when I realized that despite my success online, I wasn’t enjoying the moment—any moment,
really. Even while doing things I once loved, my mind was somewhere else, constantly buzzing with the need to check my phone.
I felt restless, unfocused, and, most importantly, I wasn’t happy.

This got me wondering: Could I be addicted to the stress of it all? The answer, unfortunately, was yes. 
Like so many of us in today’s world, I had become hooked on my own stress hormones, particularly cortisol,
the very hormone our body releases in response to stress.

## The Connection Between Cortisol and Social Media

Cortisol is often called the “stress hormone,” and for good reason. It’s released when we feel pressure, anxiety, or danger. 
In small amounts, it’s helpful; it’s what kept our ancestors alert to predators. But in today’s world, predators have been
replaced by constant notifications, endless streams of information, and the pressure to keep up with everyone’s highlight reels 
on social media.

Every time you pick up your phone to scroll through social media during a break at work or while standing in line,
your brain gets a little hit of stress—amplified if you’re comparing yourself to others or feeling like you’re missing out. 
This becomes a vicious cycle. You feel a little stressed, check your phone, feel even more stressed, and repeat.


## Signs You Might Be Addicted to Cortisol (and Social Media)

If any of these sound like you, you might be stuck in this cycle too:

You’re always looking at your phone between tasks: Whether it’s between meetings, during lunch, 
or even while doing something else, you can’t resist checking your phone.

You scroll through social media even when you’re busy: You might be in the middle of something important,
but you keep sneaking peeks at your social feeds as if you’re missing out on something crucial.

You constantly compare yourself to others: Seeing everyone’s perfect vacations, career milestones,
or even their healthy meals makes you feel like you’re not doing enough, even if you’ve got plenty to be proud of.

You feel restless or anxious when you’re not on your phone: If you’re not connected, you feel a strange emptiness or 
like you’re out of the loop.

You can’t fully enjoy the moment: Even during moments of joy—time with friends, a beautiful sunset, 
a creative project—your mind drifts back to your phone. It’s hard to stay present when you’re constantly thinking about checking in.



## Why This Happens

Social media is designed to keep us hooked. Each like, comment, and notification releases dopamine, the "feel-good" 
chemical in our brain. It feels like a little reward every time we get one. But on the flip side, when we don’t get that 
constant validation, or we see others living lives that seem more exciting than our own, we feel inadequate.
And here’s where cortisol kicks in, keeping us stressed and always reaching for more.

Over time, this stress becomes addictive. It’s not that we love the anxiety, but our bodies get used to the rush of cortisol,
making it harder and harder to break free from the cycle.

### How to Overcome the Stress.

The good news is, there are ways to break the habit and find peace again. It’s not about quitting social media entirely,
but about regaining control and finding contentment in the real world.

Set boundaries with your phone: One of the simplest, yet most effective, things you can do is to create intentional 
"no-phone" zones in your life. For example, keep your phone out of reach during meals, and avoid checking it first 
thing in the morning or right before bed. Start small—maybe 15-minute blocks—and work your way up.

Unfollow and mute mindfully: If certain accounts make you feel less than or trigger your comparison trap,
mute or unfollow them. Curate your feed so that it inspires and uplifts you, rather than feeding your insecurities.

Schedule social media time: Instead of mindlessly scrolling throughout the day, designate specific times when 
you can check your social feeds. This gives you a sense of control and prevents you from constantly reaching for
your phone in between tasks.

Practice mindfulness and gratitude: Start a daily practice of mindfulness—whether it’s meditation, deep breathing,
or simply paying attention to your surroundings without distraction. Pair this with gratitude. 
Every day, write down or mentally note three things you’re grateful for in a journal.
This helps shift your focus away from what you don’t have (or what others have) to what’s good in your own life.

Do a digital detox: Set aside a weekend—or even just a few hours—where you completely disconnect from your 
phone and social media. Use that time to reconnect with yourself, your loved ones, and your passions. 
You’ll be amazed at how peaceful and present you feel when your brain isn’t constantly buzzing with notifications.

Engage in real-life hobbies: Rediscover activities that bring you joy away from the screen. 
Whether it’s painting, hiking, cooking, or reading, filling your time with meaningful offline activities can help you regain balance.

Remember: It’s not real life: Remind yourself that social media is a curated version of reality. 
Everyone’s showing their best moments, not their struggles. Comparing your behind-the-scenes to 
someone else’s highlight reel is a recipe for stress.

### Finding Peace in the Present

Breaking free from the cycle of stress and social media addiction won’t happen overnight, 
but with patience and persistence, it’s entirely possible. The key is to start recognizing the signs, 
setting boundaries, and creating space for real life—where joy, contentment, and peace truly live.

I’m still on my journey, learning to embrace the present and find happiness beyond the screen. 
And trust me, the real world is worth it. Let’s take that step together—because we all deserve a 
life where we’re not slaves to our screens, but instead fully engaged in the beauty of the here and now.

You got this!
